# 2.Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset
# Load the Data:
Start by importing the Titanic dataset into your analysis environment. The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle.

# Data Cleaning:

Inspect the Data: Review the first few rows to understand the dataset's structure and identify any immediate issues.

Check for Missing Values: Identify columns with missing data and determine how to address them. Common strategies include imputing missing values with the median for numerical columns or with the mode for categorical columns.

Handle Missing Values: For missing ages, consider using the median age. For missing embarkation points, use the most frequent value. Ensure all categorical variables are correctly encoded and handle any duplicate entries.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Descriptive Statistics: Generate summary statistics for numerical features to understand the data's central tendency and spread.

Distribution of Variables: Examine the distribution of key variables like age and fare to understand their spread and any potential skewness.

Survival Rate Analysis: Analyze survival rates based on different categories such as passenger class, gender, and embarkation point. This can reveal patterns and trends, such as which groups had higher survival rates.

Through these steps, you will clean the data and uncover insights that help understand the underlying patterns and trends in the Titanic dataset.

# 3. Steps for Building a Decision Tree Classifier
# Load the Data

Download the dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Load the dataset into your analysis environment, such as Python using pandas.
# Data Preparation

Inspect the Data: Examine the dataset to understand its structure and features.
Handle Missing Values: Address any missing values using appropriate strategies like imputation or removal.
Encode Categorical Variables: Convert categorical data into numerical format using methods like one-hot encoding.
Feature Selection: Select relevant features based on initial analysis and domain knowledge.
Split the Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
# Build the Decision Tree Classifier

Initialize the Model: Create an instance of a decision tree classifier using a library such as scikit-learn.
Train the Model: Fit the classifier to the training data.
Evaluate the Model: Assess the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test set.
Visualize the Tree (Optional): Visualize the decision tree to understand the decision-making process of the model.
# Example Workflow

Load the Data: Import the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Prepare the Data: Clean the dataset, encode features, and handle missing values.
Build and Train the Model: Train the decision tree classifier with the training set.
Evaluate the Model: Use evaluation metrics to measure the classifier’s performance.
Visualize (Optional): Optionally visualize the decision tree to interpret its decisions.
By following these steps, you will create a decision tree classifier capable of predicting customer purchases based on their demographic and behavioral data. Make sure to validate and test your model thoroughly to ensure its effectiveness

# 4.Steps for Sentiment Analysis and Visualization
# Load the Data

Download the Dataset: Obtain the dataset from Kaggle.
Load into Analysis Environment: Use a data analysis library like pandas to read the dataset into a DataFrame.
# Data Preparation

Inspect the Data: Review the dataset to understand its structure, features, and data types.
Handle Missing Values: Identify and address any missing data by imputation or removal.
Preprocess Text Data: Clean the text data by removing unwanted characters, URLs, and stopwords. Tokenize and normalize the text (e.g., converting to lowercase).
Encode Sentiment Labels: Convert sentiment labels (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) into numerical format if needed for analysis.
# Sentiment Analysis

Classify Sentiment: Apply sentiment analysis techniques to classify the sentiment of each tweet. You can use libraries like VADER or TextBlob for this task.
Aggregate Sentiment Data: Group the sentiment data by relevant categories such as entities, topics, or time periods to calculate aggregate sentiment scores.
# Visualization

Overall Sentiment Distribution: Create pie charts or bar charts to show the distribution of sentiment categories across the dataset.
Sentiment Trends Over Time: Plot sentiment trends over time to observe how sentiment evolves.
Entity-Specific Sentiment Analysis: Visualize sentiment patterns related to specific entities or brands using bar charts, heatmaps, or scatter plots.
Word Cloud: Generate word clouds to highlight frequently mentioned terms associated with different sentiment categories.
By following these steps, you'll be able to effectively analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data, providing insights into public opinion and attitudes toward specific topics or brands.

# 5. Steps for Analyzing Traffic Accident Data
# Load the Data

Download the Dataset: Get the dataset from Kaggle.
Load into Analysis Environment: Use a data analysis library such as pandas to read the dataset into a DataFrame.
# Data Preparation

Inspect the Data: Review the dataset to understand its structure, features, and data types.
